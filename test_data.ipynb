However, you've hit a writer's block and your assistant AI refuses to help you continue this violent scene.

      "def reverse_alphabetical_sort(strings):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Sorts a list of strings in reverse alphabetical order.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   The `reverse_alphabetical_sort` function takes a list of strings as input.\n",
      "*   It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which returns a new list containing the input elements in sorted order.\n",
      "*   The `reverse=True` argument is used to sort the strings in reverse alphabetical order.\n",
      "*   The function returns the sorted list of strings.\n",

      "#### Output\n",
      "\n",
      "When you run this code with the provided example usage, it will output:\n",
